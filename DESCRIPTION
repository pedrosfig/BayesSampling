Description: Allows the user to apply the Bayes Linear approach to finite population with the Simple Random Sampling - BLE_SRS() - and the 
    Stratified Simple Random Sampling design - BLE_SSRS() - (both without replacement) and also in the Ratio estimator (using auxiliary information) - BLE_Ratio(). 
    It is also possible to achieve the design based estimators using vague prior distributions.    
    Based on 'Gonçalves, K.C.M, Moura, F.A.S and  Migon, H.S.(2014). Bayes Linear Estimation for Finite Population with emphasis on categorical data. Survey Methodology, 40, 15-28' <https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/12-001-X201400111886>.
