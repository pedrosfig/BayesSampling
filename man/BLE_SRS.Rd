\usage{
BLE_SRS(ys, N, m = NULL, v = NULL, sigma = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ys}{vector of sample observations.}

\item{N}{total size of the population.}

\item{m}{prior mean. If NULL, sample mean will be used (non-informative prior).}

\item{v}{prior variance of an element from the population (bigger than sigma^2). If NULL, it will tend to infinity (non-informative prior).}

\item{sigma}{prior estimate of variability (standard deviation) within the population. If NULL, sample variance will be used.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components: \itemize{
\item \code{est.beta} - BLE of Beta (BLE for every individual)
\item \code{Vest.beta} - Variance associated with the above
\item \code{est.mean} - BLE for each individual not in the sample
\item \code{Vest.mean} - Covariance matrix associated with the above
\item \code{est.tot} - BLE for the total
\item \code{Vest.tot} - Variance associated with the above
}
}
